# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project!

This repository follows a simple and clean workflow to keep the main branch stable
and reviewable.

## Branch Strategy

- `main` is protected and only accepts pull requests
- Active development happens on `dev`
- Feature work should be done in dedicated branches (e.g. `feature/readiness-score`)

## Pull Requests

- Open pull requests against `dev`
- Keep changes focused and well-described
- Make sure commits are meaningful and easy to review

## Code Style

- Follow the existing project structure
- Keep security and clarity in mind
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

Feedback and improvements are always welcome!
